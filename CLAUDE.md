## Quick Navigation

| Want to... | Read first | Skip |
|---|---|---|
| Fix a bug | `docs/WORKFLOW.md` + affected `.jsx` file | Everything else |
| Build a new feature | `docs/WORKFLOW.md` + relevant spec in `docs/specs/` | Unrelated components |
| Start a new session | `CLAUDE.md` + latest file in `docs/handoffs/` | `node_modules`, configs |
| Write a Base44 prompt | Feature spec + affected component files | Assets, unrelated pages |
| Add a hook | `src/components/hooks/` only | Anywhere else |

---

## Naming Conventions

| File type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Feature spec | `spec_[feature].md` | `spec_scheduled-serve.md` |
| Session handoff | `handoff_[YYYY-MM-DD].md` | `handoff_2026-04-24.md` |
| Bug note | `fix_[component]_[YYYY-MM].md` | `fix_android-camera_2026-04.md` |
| Audit note | `audit_[topic].md` | `audit_derived-state.md` |
| Components | PascalCase | `WorkerRouteDetail.jsx` |
| Hooks | camelCase with `use` prefix | `useRouteCache.js` |

---

## File Placement Rules

- **New components** → `src/components/`
- **New hooks** → `src/components/hooks/` (mandatory)
- **New screens** → `src/pages/` (auto-registers, no routing config needed)
- **Feature specs** → `docs/specs/spec_[feature].md`
- **Session handoffs** → `docs/handoffs/handoff_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
- **Never touch** → `pages.config.js` (Base44 regenerates on every deploy)

---

## Push to GitHub (Joshua runs this after every delivery)
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Claude/serveroute-v2 && git add -A && git commit -m "your message" && git push
```
Base44 auto-syncs. Build status: **"Live"** = deployed. **"Building"** = still syncing. Wait for Live before concluding a fix didn't work.

---

## Hard Rules (never break these)
- Read the file before editing it — never write from memory
- Return complete files only — no snippets, no partial edits
- Only modify files explicitly requested — no drive-by changes
- Use `refetchQueries` not `invalidateQueries`
- Never mutate cached arrays directly — spread first: `[...array].sort()`
- Any new modal with input gets: `onInteractOutside={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` and `onEscapeKeyDown={(e) => e.preventDefault()}`
- Any button firing a DB write gets a `disabled` state guard
- `company_id` on every new database entity from day one

---

## Workspace Audit

This workspace uses `routetoserve-gemma:latest` for small tasks via Cline.
Audit results recorded in: `~/Desktop/Claude/Skills/GEMMA_WORKSPACE_AUDIT.md`

Re-run the audit any time this CLAUDE.md changes significantly or new files are added.
Audit prompt lives in the audit doc — paste into Cline with routetoserve-gemma, record results.

---

## Field Bug Reports

Bugs logged from the field via Telegram bot are saved to Google Drive and synced locally.
Haiku structures every report using the instructions in `rts-bot-instructions.md` (stored in Drive > Claude Workspaces > Bot).

**Bug intake path (new reports land here first):**
```
~/Desktop/Claude/Claude Workspaces/RouteToServe/Bug Reports/Bug Intake/
```

**Bug lifecycle folders:**
```
Bug Reports/
├── Bug Intake/     ← new reports land here (Open)
├── Stability/      ← confirmed bugs being tracked
├── Features/       ← feature requests from the field
├── Horizon/        ← future ideas, not current sprint
In Progress/        ← bugs actively being worked
Archived/           ← resolved and closed
```

**File format:** All reports are `.md` files, not `.txt`.
Naming convention: `BUG_YYYY-MM-DD_short-slug.md`

**When Joshua says "let's fix the bugs", "load the bugs", or anything about field bugs:**
1. Read all `.md` files in `Bug Reports/Bug Intake/`
2. List them numbered with title, severity, and one-line summary
3. Work through them one at a time — fix, verify, then move to the next
4. When a bug is fixed and confirmed by Joshua, move the file to `Archived/` — do not delete it

**Do not wait to be told where to look — always check Bug Intake first when bugs are mentioned.**
